                <p>
                    We are owned and operated by a group of parents from all over the world. Our founders were unhappy with the quality of the early childhood education available in their cities, so they got together to build a truly 21st century program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We now have schools around the globe, which bring together the worldâ€™s best early years practices to deliver the finest preschool experience for children and parents alike.
